# My Design System

Just include it in your `application.scss` using:

```
@import "normalize-scss";
@import "persand-design-system";
```

## Prerequisite: Normalize.css

The design system should be used together with Normalize.css. If you've installed the design system with Bower (which you should) then [appleboy/normalize.scss](https://github.com/appleboy/normalize.scss) will have been downloaded for you.

If it for some reason hasn't then run this:

`$ bower install normalize-scss --save`

## Updating the Design System

If changes has been made to [kollegorna/design-system](https://github.com/persand/design-system) then just run:

`$ bower update`
